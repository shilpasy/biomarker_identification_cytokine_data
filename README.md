This repository contains exploratory and modeling code for analyzing cytokine expression profiles in a mouse model of Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS).
We aim to:

    Identify plasma cytokine signatures that distinguish wild-type from Trp53-mutant mice at baseline (prior to any treatment).

    Build treatment-response classifiers to predict rapamycin exposure using timepoint-resolved cytokine profiles.

    Explore biomarker redundancy and correlation structure, guiding selection of robust, non-redundant cytokines.

    Derive interpretable, assay-ready formulas that can inform early cancer detection and immune modulation in LFS models.

All analyses are performed on a panel of 45 cytokines measured longitudinally across multiple timepoints and genotypes. The goal is to generate mechanistically relevant and experimentally testable hypotheses that can be extended to human studies.
